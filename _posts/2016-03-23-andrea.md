The health and wellbeing of males, specifically during their adolescent years, continues to pose as a significant public health concern.

We must gain better insight into the perceptions and beliefs of these adolescent and young adult males (AYAM) in order to create effective and personalized treatment plans. In efforts to abide by the Precision Medicine Initiative, current research at the University of Central Florida, led by Dr. Michael Rovito and the members of the  Behavioral Health Research Group (BHRG), have ongoing research projects that look into the current gender based health disparity, proposals that initiate positive behavioral changes among males in relation to health, and implementation of programs tailored to the healthcare needs of the AYAM population.
