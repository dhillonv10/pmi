Nodari will be talking the opportunities granted to UCF through NSF's Innovation Corps program, and his past involvement with the program.

UCF researchers and faculty have contributed to the discovery of groundbreaking technologies in disciplines including photonics, biotechnology, nanotechnology, and computer vision. Now, thanks to a Foundation (NSF) Innovation Corps (I-Corps) grant, teams of researchers and aspiring entrepreneurs have the opportunity to immerse themselves in guidance and knowledge from leading industry experts. I-Corps leads qualified entrepreneurial teams through a five-week “bootcamp” of learning, evaluating and transferring knowledge into marketable products which have a benefit or impact on society. UCF is partnering throughout Florida with other universities and research centers to expand the I-Corps program and firmly position Central Florida as a leader in the “Lean Startup Movement.”
