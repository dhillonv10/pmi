Precision Medicine Initiative was announced last year to make strides towards delivering personalized treatments to patients, taking into account the history, genes, environments, and lifestyle of individuals. Molecular testing for cancer patients lets physicians and patients select treatments that improve chances of survival and reduce adverse effects. Genetic and other information can help identify the best depression drug for each patient and speed effective treatment, a critical advancement as patients often do not respond to the first drug they are prescribed. But more is needed. There are still far too many diseases for which there are no good treatments.
